-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This font has been created in an attempt to reproduce the typeface from the
classic Frontier & Frontier:First Encounters games produced by Frontier
Developments in 1993 & 1995 respectively.

Frontier: Elite, Frontier:First Encounters and all their contents are under
copyright so it is probably illegal to own this font.

            It will be removed immediately if anyone complains.


INSTALLATION:

This is very easy: Install to the FONT folder in your Windows directory.

OTHER INFO:

The Frontier Font is a 'pixel exact' font and has been optimized at font
sizes of:

px (pixel) sizes
9-30, 32, 34, 40, 48 and multiples of 10 (50, 60, 70, etc)

Because I have tried to recreate the Frontier typeface as close as possible
there are some limitations in using this font compared to how you would use
any other TrueType Font (Arial, Times New Roman, etc).

useful tips on using the font:
